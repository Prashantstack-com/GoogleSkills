# Google Cloud Skills Boost Labs Portfolio

Hands-on labs completed on **Google Cloud Skills Boost** (formerly Qwiklabs).  
This repo documents my practical experience with Google Cloud services through guided labs. Each subfolder contains a detailed README with:

- Key objectives
- Step-by-step commands (gcloud, kubectl, etc.)
- What I learned
- Any notes on outcomes or best practices

Labs are temporary in the Skills Boost environment (projects auto-delete after the timer), so these write-ups serve as my verifiable summary of the hands-on work.
